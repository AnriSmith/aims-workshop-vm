Notebooks cover Unsupervised Learning

## Info on Workshp

It will be hosted at AIMS South Africa from 22 to 27 May 2017 and will introduce participants to the mathematical underpinnings, computational challenges, and applications of Data Science. The computation will focus on a selection of Machine Learning algorithms using the Python programming language. Finally, the applications will give participants the opportunity to mathematically conceptualize problems and eventually use computing tools to solve these problems. Besides, there would be motivational talks given by invited speakers on their work that involved the use of Data Science. There will be a session on the basics of data visualization.
